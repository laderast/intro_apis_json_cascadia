## These are the packages you need:

```{r setup}
library(httr2)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyjson)
library(leaflet)
library(plumber)
```

- [Posit Cloud Project](https://posit.cloud/content/5481225)
- You will need a free posit.cloud project to clone it.

## Learning Objectives 

:::{.incremental}

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

- **Define** web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and how to interact with them
- **Utilize** the `{httr2}` package to send requests to an API
- **Use** the `{jsonlite}` to extract data frames
- **Utilize** `{tidyjson}` to extract data from JSON files

:::

## What are APIs? {.incremental}

You may have heard of the term and wondered what it means. API is short for **A**pplication **P**rogram **I**nterface. In general, an API provides a way to interact with a code library. 

We'll be using a very specific definition: 

> An API is a programmatic way to interact with a webservice that allows us to automate the retrieval of data.

Even more specifically, we'll focus on Web APIs that let us fetch data.

## The Basic Recipe 

:::{.incremental}

1. Try to make sense of the API documentation
1. Identify an API endpoint
1. Request data/information using an API endpoint (GET/POST)
1. Receive a response from the API server
1. Figure out how to get the data out of the response
:::

## Let's make it more concrete 

- One API that's available is [Cat Facts](https://catfact.ninja/). 

- [API documentation for Cat Facts](https://catfact.ninja/docs/api-docs.json), --> **endpoints** that are defined.

- **Endpoints** are ways to communicate with the API


## What is an endpoint?

- Literally, an endpoint like `/fact` goes at the end of a URL, such as:
```
https://catfact.ninja/fact
```

- I tend to think of endpoints like calling functions in a library.



## Let's Try it Out

For example, if I wanted a random cat fact:

<https://catfact.ninja/fact>

The response from catfact.ninja is something like this:

```
{"fact":"If your cat snores, or rolls over on his back to expose his belly, it means he trusts you.","length":90}
```

This is in JSON format, which we'll talk about in a sec.

## Request {auto-animate=true}

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
sequenceDiagram
    Our Computer->>+API Server: https://catfact.ninja/fact
```

## Response {auto-animate=true}

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
sequenceDiagram
    Our Computer->>+API Server: https://catfact.ninja/fact
    API Server->>+Our Computer: {"fact": "cats are cool", length: 34} 
```

## Calling APIs from R using `httr2`

Okay, now we have an API endpoint we want to hit: <https://catfact.ninja/fact>. 

How do we call it in R? We use `{httr2}`

```{r}
url <- "https://catfact.ninja/fact"

req <- httr2::request(url)
```

## Looking at what we send with `httr2::req_dry_run()`

```{r}
req |>
  httr2::req_dry_run()
```

Passing `req` into `httr2::req_dry_run()` will show us everything that `httr2` will send along with our request to the API server. 

## Parts of a HTTP request (GET)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
```{r}
#| echo: false
req |>
  httr2::req_dry_run()
```
:::

::: {.column}

|Part|Code|
|----|----|
| Http Method | `GET` |
| Host | `catfact.ninja`|
| endpoint | `/fact`|
|`User-Agent`|`httr2/0.2.2` |
:::
::::

## Calling the API using `req_perform()`

Let's actually call the Cat Facts API:

```{r}
response <- req |>
  req_perform()

response
```
Note there's a `GET` in our request. That is one of the methods for requesting via HTTP. We'll talk a little more about `POST` when we build JSON requests.


## Response from catfact.ninja

We can see that we get a structure that has a `Body`, which has what we're looking for. Specifically the Body contains a `content-type` of `application/json`.

```{r}
response |>
  httr2::resp_raw()
```

## Parts of an HTTP Response

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column}
```{r}
#| echo: false
response |>
  httr2::resp_raw()
```
:::

:::{.column}
|Part|Code|
|----|----|
| Http Method | `GET` |
| URL | `catfact.ninja/fact`|
| Content-Type | `application/json`|
|Body|`{"fact":"In 1987, cats overtook ..."}` |

:::
::::

## We just want the body

So we can extract the body information using `httr2::resp_body_json()` (Your fact will differ from mine):

```{r}
json_bit <- response |>
  httr2::resp_body_json()

json_bit
```

## JSON is returned as a list

Ok, we've got a list and we need to extract our info:

```{r}
json_bit$fact
```

## What is this JSON stuff?

- **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation
- Common format for communicating with Application Program Interface (API) servers and receiving results/data from that API


## Why is knowing JSON useful?

- It is used to encode data
- It is used to send requests using POST


# APIs use JSON to handle both requests and responses

## Example of JSON

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
### JSON
```
[{"zebra":"horse"}, 
 {"cow":"donkey"}
]
```

:::

:::{.column}
:::

::::



## How does R translate JSON?

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
As we've discovered, JSON objects are mostly converted to lists in R using either `httr2` or `jsonlite`.

But we often want a `data.frame`!
:::

:::{.column}
!["I Just Wanted a Data Frame"](data.frame.jpeg)
:::
::::

## Let's try another endpoint

Let's dive deeper into `catfact.ninja`. There's an endpoint called `/facts` and let's figure out how to get the information out.

Change your `url` to <https://catfact.ninja/facts> and see what happens. How does the returned structure differ from <https://catfact.ninja/fact>?

## Response

```{r}
url <- "https://catfact.ninja/facts"

resp <- httr2::request(url) |>
  httr2::req_perform() 

resp |>
  resp_raw()
```

## A More complicated response

If we poke around, we'll see that there is a list entry called "data" in `resp`. `data` is in a list format, where each element has a `length` and a `fact`. We can extract this using `purrr::map()` and use `unlist()` to simplify it.

```{r}
#| echo: true
resp_json <- resp |>
  resp_body_json()

names(resp_json)
```

## It's a List!

If we dig further, we can see that the `$data` slot is a numbered list. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
resp_json$data
```

## JSON versus R-Lists

|JSON|R-List|
|----|------|
|`[]`|Unnamed list (has numbered slots)|
|`{}`|Named List (has named slots)|
|key:value|`key=value`|

## Example of JSON/R-List

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
### JSON
```
[{"zebra":"horse"},
 {"cow":"donkey"}
]
```

:::

:::{.column}
### R-List

```
list( 
  list(zebra="horse"),
  list(cow="donkey")
  )
```
:::

::::


## `purrr` to the rescue

We want the 10 facts out of the list. We can use `purrr::pluck()` to extract the `data` slot and `purrr::map` to grab the fact for each of the numbered slots:

```{r}
#| echo: true

newresp <- resp |>
  httr2::resp_body_json() |>
  purrr::pluck("data") |>
  purrr::map(~.x$fact)

unlist(newresp)
```


## Datasets that are Provided as JSON

Here's one dataset that is actually provided as JSON: [Citibikes API](https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json). If you click on this link, it will retrieve a JSON file directly.

Here's the first few lines of this JSON file:

```
{"data":{"stations":[

{"has_kiosk":true,"rental_uris":{"android":"https://bkn.lft.to/lastmile_qr_scan","ios":"https://bkn.lft.to/lastmile_qr_scan"},"name":"Harborside","eightd_has_key_dispenser":false,"external_id":"2de92329-48d0-4cf7-85df-172f91bbb320","eightd_station_services":[],"rental_methods":["KEY","CREDITCARD"],"lon":-74.034234,"capacity":30,"station_type":"classic","region_id":"70","legacy_id":"3639","station_id":"2de92329-48d0-4cf7-85df-172f91bbb320","electric_bike_surcharge_waiver":false,"short_name":"JC104","lat":40.7192517},

{"has_kiosk":true,"rental_uris":{"android":"https://bkn.lft.to/lastmile_qr_scan","ios":"https://bkn.lft.to/lastmile_qr_scan"},"name":"11 St & Washington St","eightd_has_key_dispenser":false,"external_id":"f417d8da-0f15-49b0-9e3c-3c3e55c2691d","eightd_station_services":[],"rental_methods":["KEY","CREDITCARD"],"lon":-74.02715027332306,"capacity":24,"station_type":"classic","region_id":"311","legacy_id":"4518","station_id":"f417d8da-0f15-49b0-9e3c-3c3e55c2691d","electric_bike_surcharge_waiver":false,"short_name":"HB502","lat":40.74998490907138},

{"has_kiosk":true,"rental_uris":{"android":"https://bkn.lft.to/lastmile_qr_scan","ios":"https://bkn.lft.to/lastmile_qr_scan"},"name":"4 St & Grand St","eightd_has_key_dispenser":false,"external_id":"3d1db3fa-1df5-46c8-baf3-619b729f5bda","eightd_station_services":[],"rental_methods":
...
```

## WTF

OMG, this is way too complex! The `{jsonlite}` package gives us a function called `fromJSON()` that will decode this datasource:

```{r}
citibikes <- fromJSON("https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json")
names(citibikes)
```

## WTF, Part 2

The `data` slot of this list contains the actual data about the stations. 

This data was originally encoded in JSON, but `jsonlite::fromJSON()` is smart enough to guess that it's a `data.frame`. 

That's because the JSON was organized as a list, with each row encoded as a separate object.

```{r}
knitr::kable(data.frame(citibikes$data$stations))
```

## Leaflet is awesome

Now we have the `data.frame` Let's plot these stations:

```{r}
library(leaflet)

cit <- data.frame(citibikes$data$stations)

leaflet::leaflet(cit) |>
  addTiles() |>
  setView(lng = -74.0060, lat=   40.7128, zoom=12) |>
  addCircles(lat = ~lat, lng = ~lon)

```


## Where Next?

We've only covered APIs that don't require authentication. To access a lot of APIs, you will need an authentication token that you will need to provide in your API request.

<https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/wrapping-apis.html#secret-management>

## Play with some free APIs

<https://apipheny.io/free-api/>

## More About APIs

If you want a larger overview of APIs, this is a nice course and document: <https://zapier.com/learn/apis/> 

It describes in much greater detail about request and response structure, the types of requests (GET, POST, SET, DELETE), and API design.

## Http Testing in R

This book [Http Testing in R](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/) is where you should go next if you're interested in building an API package, as it shows you how to build tests using a mock data server using `{webmockr}`, which is extremely helpful for debugging without hitting an API too many times.

# Making your own APIs

## Don't forget `{pins}`

If you need to share data, the `{pins}` package is a lightweight way to share it using something like a shared Dropbox folder.
