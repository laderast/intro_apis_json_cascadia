## These are the packages you need:

```{r setup}
library(httr2)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyjson)
library(leaflet)
library(plumber)
```

- [Posit Cloud Project](https://posit.cloud/content/5481225)
- You will need a free posit.cloud project to clone it.

## Who this talk is for

- Anyone who has heard the term "API" and ran away in fear
- Those who have never made APIs calls in R

## Learning Objectives 

:::{.incremental}

By the end of this talk, you should be able to:

- **Define** web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and how to interact with them
- **Utilize** the `{httr2}` package to send requests and receive responses to an API
- **Use** the `{jsonlite}` package to extract data frames

:::

## What are APIs? {.incremental}

**A**pplication **P**rogram **I**nterface. 

> An API is a programmatic way to interact with a webservice that allows us to automate the retrieval of data.

## The Basic Recipe 

:::{.incremental}
1. Try to make sense of the API documentation
1. Identify an API endpoint
1. Request data/information using an API endpoint (GET/POST)
1. Receive a response from the API server
1. **Figure out how to get the data out of the response**
:::

## Let's make it more concrete 

- Cat Facts API: <https://catfact.ninja>
- [API documentation for Cat Facts](https://catfact.ninja/docs/api-docs.json), 
- **Endpoints** are ways to communicate with the API

## What is an endpoint?

- An endpoint like `/fact` goes at the end of the URL:
```
https://catfact.ninja/fact
```


## Let's Try it Out


<https://catfact.ninja/fact>

```
{"fact":"If your cat snores, or rolls over on his back to expose his belly, it means he trusts you.","length":90}
```

:::{.notes}
For example, if I wanted a random cat fact:

The response from catfact.ninja is something like this.

This is in JSON format, which we'll talk about in a sec.
:::

## Request {auto-animate=true}

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
sequenceDiagram
    Our Computer->>+API Server: https://catfact.ninja/fact
```

## Response {auto-animate=true}

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
sequenceDiagram
    Our Computer->>+API Server: https://catfact.ninja/fact
    API Server->>+Our Computer: {"fact": "cats are cool", length: 34} 
```

## Calling APIs from R using `httr2`

```{r}
url <- "https://catfact.ninja/fact"

req <- httr2::request(url)
```

:::{.notes}
How do we call our endpoint in R? We use the `{httr2}` package.
:::

## Look at what we send: `httr2::req_dry_run()`

```{r}
req |>
  httr2::req_dry_run()
```

:::{.notes}
Passing `req` into `httr2::req_dry_run()` will show us everything that `httr2` will send along with our request to the API server. 
:::

## Parts of a HTTP request (GET)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r}
#| echo: false
req |>
  httr2::req_dry_run()
```
:::

::: {.column}

|Part|Code|
|----|----|
| Http Method | `GET` |
| Host | `catfact.ninja`|
| endpoint | `/fact`|
|`User-Agent`|`httr2/0.2.2` |
:::
::::

## Calling the API using `req_perform()`

```{r}
response <- req |>
  req_perform()

response
```

:::{.notes}
Let's actually call the Cat Facts API:

Note there's a `GET` in our request. That is one of the methods for requesting via HTTP. We'll talk a little more about `POST` when we build JSON requests.
:::

## Response from catfact.ninja

```{r}
response |>
  httr2::resp_raw()
```

:::{.notes}
We can see that we get a structure that has a `Body`, which has what we're looking for. Specifically the Body contains a `content-type` of `application/json`.
:::

## Parts of an HTTP Response

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column}
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
server: nginx
date: Fri, 18 Aug 2023 15:37:48 GMT
content-type: application/json

[....]

{"fact":"The lightest cat on record is a blue point Himalayan called Tinker Toy, who weighed 1 pound, 6 ounces (616 g). Tinker Toy was 2.75 inches (7 cm) tall and 7.5 inches (19 cm) long.","length":178}
```
:::

:::{.column}
|Part|Code|
|----|----|
| Http Method | `GET` |
| URL | `catfact.ninja/fact`|
| Content-Type | `application/json`|
|Body|`{"fact":"The lightest cat on record ..."}` |
:::
::::

## We just want the body

```{r}
json_bit <- response |>
  httr2::resp_body_json()

json_bit
```

:::{.notes}
So we can extract the body information using `httr2::resp_body_json()` (Your fact will differ from mine):
:::

## JSON is returned as a list

```{r}
json_bit$fact
```

:::{.notes}
Ok, we've got a list and we need to extract our info.
:::

## What is JSON?

- **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation

:::{.notes}
- Common format for communicating with Application Program Interface (API) servers and receiving results/data from that API
:::

## Why is knowing JSON useful?

- Send requests using POST
- Used to encode data in the API responses


# APIs use JSON to handle both requests and responses

## Example of JSON

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
### JSON
```
[{"zebra":"horse"}, 
 {"cow":"donkey"}
]
```

:::

:::{.column}
:::

::::

## How does R translate JSON?

!["I Just Wanted a Data Frame"](data.frame.jpeg)

:::{.notes}
As we've discovered, JSON objects are mostly converted to lists in R using either `httr2` or `jsonlite`.

But we often want a `data.frame`!
:::

## The (Good?) News

- JSON gets translated to lists in R
- You don't have to know JSON

## JSON versus R-Lists

|JSON|R-List|
|----|------|
|`[]`|Unnamed list (has numbered slots)|
|`{}`|Named List (has named slots)|
|key:value|`key=value`|


## Example of JSON/R-List

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
### JSON
```
[{"zebra":"horse"},
 {"cow":"donkey"}
]
```

:::

:::{.column}
### R-List

```
list( 
  list(zebra="horse"),
  list(cow="donkey")
  )
```
:::

::::

## Let's try another endpoint

```
https://catninja/facts
```

:::{.notes}
Let's dive deeper into `catfact.ninja`. There's an endpoint called `/facts` and let's figure out how to get the information out.

Change your `url` to <https://catfact.ninja/facts> and see what happens. How does the returned structure differ from <https://catfact.ninja/fact>?
:::

## Sending our Request

```{r}
url <- "https://catfact.ninja/facts"

resp <- httr2::request(url) |>
  httr2::req_perform() 

resp |>
  resp_raw()
```


## Response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
server: nginx
date: Fri, 18 Aug 2023 15:37:48 GMT
content-type: application/json
[....]
{"current_page":1,"data":[{"fact":"Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.","length":114},{"fact":"When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down.","length":97},{"fact":"The technical term for a cat\u2019s hairball is a \u201cbezoar.\u201d","length":54}
[....]
```


## A More complicated response

```{r}
#| echo: true
resp_json <- resp |>
  resp_body_json()

names(resp_json)
```

:::{.notes}
If we poke around, we'll see that there is a list entry called "data" in `resp`. `data` is in a list format, where each element has a `length` and a `fact`. We can extract this using `purrr::map()` and use `unlist()` to simplify it.
:::

## It's a List!

```{r}
#| echo: true
resp_json$data
```

:::{.notes}
If we dig further, we can see that the `$data` slot is a numbered list. 
:::





## `purrr` to the rescue

```{r}
#| echo: true

newresp <- resp |>
  httr2::resp_body_json() |>
  purrr::pluck("data") |>
  purrr::map(~.x$fact)

unlist(newresp)
```

# Other JSON formats

## Datasets that are Provided as JSON

Citibikes API: <https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json>

```
{"data":{"stations":[

{"has_kiosk":true,"rental_uris":{"android":"https://bkn.lft.to/lastmile_qr_scan","ios":"https://bkn.lft.to/lastmile_qr_scan"},"name":"Harborside","eightd_has_key_dispenser":false,"external_id":"2de92329-48d0-4cf7-85df-172f91bbb320","eightd_station_services":[],"rental_methods":["KEY","CREDITCARD"],"lon":-74.034234,"capacity":30,"station_type":"classic","region_id":"70","legacy_id":"3639","station_id":"2de92329-48d0-4cf7-85df-172f91bbb320","electric_bike_surcharge_waiver":false,"short_name":"JC104","lat":40.7192517},

...
```

:::{.notes}
Here's one dataset that is actually provided as JSON:

If you click on this link, it will retrieve a JSON file directly.

Here's the first few lines of this JSON file:
:::

## WTF - This is way too complex! 

```{r}
citibikes <- fromJSON("https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json")
names(citibikes)
names(citibikes$data)
```

:::{.notes}
The `{jsonlite}` package gives us a function called `fromJSON()` that will decode this datasource.
:::

## WTF, Part 2

```{r}
knitr::kable(data.frame(citibikes$data$stations))
```

:::{.notes}
The `data` slot of this list contains the actual data about the stations. 

This data was originally encoded in JSON, but `jsonlite::fromJSON()` is smart enough to guess that it's a `data.frame`. 

That's because the JSON was organized as a list, with each row encoded as a separate object.
:::

## Leaflet is awesome

```{r}
cit <- data.frame(citibikes$data$stations)

leaflet::leaflet(cit) |>
  addTiles() |>
  setView(lng = -74.0060, lat= 40.7128, zoom=12) |>
  addCircles(lat = ~lat, lng = ~lon)
```

:::{.notes}
Now we have the `data.frame` Let's plot these stations:
:::

# Sending more info to the API

## GET: Pass information in through the URL

`https://myapi.org/search?zip_code=98552`

```{r}
httr2::request("https://myapi.org/search") |>
  httr2::req_url_query(zip_code="98552") |>
  httr2::req_dry_run()
```

:::{.notes}
Catfact.ninja doesn't require any parameters. But what about an API that requires a zipcode? 

We can pass parameters in using `req_url_query()`. This will add our parameter to the end of the URL.
:::

## POST: when you need to provide more info to the API

:::{.incremental}
- So far, we've just worked with APIs that use urls. 
- There is an alternate method called POST that lets us add a "body" to our request. 
- Guess what's in the body? Usually JSON.
:::

## GET vs. POST

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    C{Need a Body\n in Your Request?}
    C -->|No| D[GET]
    C -->|Yes| E[POST]
```

:::{.notes}
If you have a `req_body_*()` in your httr2 pipeline (such as `req_body_json()`), then your request will become a `POST`. Otherwise, the default is `GET`.
:::

## `httr2::req_body_json()`

```{r}
json_body <- list(term = "Moar about catz")

req <- request("http://example.org/search")

req %>%
  req_body_json(json_body) %>%
  req_dry_run()
```

:::{.notes}
We can pass a list into `req_body_json()` when we build our `POST` request. It will need to have the same overall structure as the one required by the API.
:::

## Where Next?

We've only covered APIs that don't require authentication. To access a lot of APIs, you will need an authentication token that you will need to provide in your API request.
